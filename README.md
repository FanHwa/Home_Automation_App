# Home Automation App

This Android Mobile Application is written to use on the Arduino Board with HC-05 Bluetooth modules
Therefore, there is a protocol to check whether the connected device is HC-05 or not.
If you are using different bluetooth module please change the uuid in the [BluetoothConnectActivity.java](https://github.com/FanHwa/Home_Automation_App/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/home_automation_app/BluetoothConnectActivity.java) file.
